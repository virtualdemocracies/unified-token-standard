# **Unified Token Standard (UniTS)**

## **[UniTS:](www.unifiedtokenstandard.com "https://unifiedtokenstandard.com")** Enabling Portability for Complex NFT assets

---

## Simple Sumary

A standard that extends the basic attributes from the existing low level NFT protocols ([ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)). Establishing **organic classes of fully featured NTFs that will be further designed and supported by the entire community.** Interactity and Portability will be finally be possible within the entire ecosystem. It is important to notice that **the Standard puts no limit on customizations**

## Abstract

The standard establishes base classes that supports and require some specific metadata and media assets. **Allowing the entire ecosystem to interconnect without the need to always be concerned about exotic attribute that a NFT may display.** Developers would already know how to explore those features when creating dApps and creators would always enforce those attributes when listing new Assets. **(While keeping available the possibility for setting optional custom attributes if the creator desires so).**

## Motivation

The [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and the ERC-1155 are remarkable, but their succint set of attributes compares to a kind of low level protocol that aims for great freedom while leaving all the heavy lifting for the implementors.

While this is great, at some point **plain protocols start hurting a whole lot more than the benefits they provides. The result is just a Babellike world of NFTs**, where each dApps/Platform is displaying their own set of attributes, that their creators opted to enforce, totally incompatible to each other, or a limited set of global attributes that are kind of useless. Given this reality dApps become a falacy. So to unleash the full power carried by the core concept within NFTs we extended those low level protocol into a higher level one, that would allow more meaningful attributes, while keeping portability. We named those powerful and portable assets, **Unified Token Assets** or just **UniTAs**
