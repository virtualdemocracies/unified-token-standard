# **Unified Token Standard (UniTS)**

## **[UniTS:](www.unifiedtokenstandard.com "https://unifiedtokenstandard.com")** Enabling Portability for Complex NFT assets

---

## Simple Summary

A standard that extends the basic attributes from the existing low level NFT protocols ([ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)).

Basically NFTs with high level features that agree on a unique standard enables interactivity and portability of complex classes of NFTs throughout the entire Web3 ecosystem. It is important to notice that **the Standard puts no limit on customization**

The main contributions are:

1. **Standardized, community based, organic classes of fully featured NTFs with verifiable provenance**.

1. **Manufacturer/Brand** entity as exclusive creator and provenance authority over all the tokenized assets under its brand.

## Abstract

The standard establishes base classes (e.g. vehicle, antique, real state) that supports and require some specific metadata and media assets. **Allowing the entire ecosystem to interconnect without the need to always be concerned about arbitrary attributes that each collection of NFTs may display.**

Developers would already know how to explore those features when creating dApps and creators would always enforce those attributes when listing new Assets. Aiming for the tokeninzation of real world assets, this protocol deliver mechanisms that **guarantee provenance of every asset**.

## Motivation

The [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and the [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) are remarkable, but their succint set of attributes compares to a kind of low level protocol that aims for great freedom while leaving all the heavy lifting for the implementors.

While this is great, at some point **plain protocols start hurting a whole lot more than the benefits they provide. The result is just a Babellike world of NFTs**, where each dApps/Platform is displaying their own set of attributes, totally incompatible to each other, or just agree on a limited set of generic attributes that are useless for the most interesting usecases for NFTs.

**Given this reality dApps become a falacy**.

So to unleash the full power of NFTs, we extended those low level protocols into a higher level one, that would allow more meaningful attributes, while keeping portability. We named those powerful and portable assets, **Unified Token Assets** or just **UniTAs**
